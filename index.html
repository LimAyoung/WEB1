<p> World Wide Web, also called WWW, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/" target="_blank" title= html5> W3 </a>, or Web, is an Internet service that allows access to various forms of data and information. Originally developed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, a browser name distributed in 1991 and international information on High Energy Physics (High Energy Physics) of the Organisation Européenne Four la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. Since then, the World Wide Web has expanded to universal Internet services, and with the development and distribution of a web browser called Mosaic in 1993, the web has continued to explode into a representative Internet service and is now reaching the present.
