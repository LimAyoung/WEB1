<p>Traditional HTML has many limitations in designing and changing web documents from time to time, with style sheets being made to complement them and the standard of style sheets being CSS. Also simply referred to as style sheets.
Creating a web page using HTML requires you to specify every detail of the font in the overall frame, but if you pre-save the style (created format) of the web page, changing just one element of the web page changes the content of the entire page at once, thus maintaining consistency throughout the document and reducing working time.
Therefore, web developers can design the web with a richer design, freely select or change the size, font, line spacing, background color, and arrangement location of the characters, and easily maintain and repair them.
